Dear ChatGPT-4,

I'm developing a program in OPENRNDR and I have encountered an issue. The program is designed to animate multiple circles on screen, with properties like width and color being influenced by image data. However, I am observing a flashing/stuttering issue with the animation of circle widths.

The circles are represented by a `Cell` class, and each instance stores its own brightness, color, and width values. Specifically, `prevW` is the width of the circle in the last scene, `goalW` is the target width for the current scene, and `renderW` is the actual width that is rendered in the current frame.

I've been using the `mix()` function from OPENRNDR to create a smooth transition between `prevW` and `goalW` across multiple frames. The `mix()` function is called in the `animW()` method within the `Cell` class. However, I suspect there's a problem in how I'm handling this transition which is causing the flashing issue.

This is the code snippet that seems to be causing the flashing:

```kotlin
fun animW() {
    renderW = mix(
        prevW,
        goalW,
        1.0
    )
}
```

When I replace the third argument with 1.0, the flashing disappears, but the transitions also disappear. We discussed using a sine function to get a value between 0.0 and 1.0 for the third argument, which improved the situation, but there's still a stuttering issue. The next attempt was to add a flag, `transitionComplete`, to control when the transitions should start and stop.

The current issue now is that the circles continue moving even after they reach the `goalW`. The desired behavior is for each circle to stop moving once it reaches its `goalW`, and only start moving again when a new goal width is set. Also, there is still a flashing issue to be resolved. The code for the entire program up to this point is provided above.

Could you help me resolve these issues and make the width transitions for the circles behave as expected?
